# Pub-Name-Generator
Generates random pub names by grabbing a collection of random nouns from the wordnik API and then choose two of them slotted between The WORD1 and WORD2. Created using **HTML**, **CSS/SASS** and **JavaScript**

## Currently loads forever as I wait for my wordnik API key (I used one i found during development and don't want to publish with it)
