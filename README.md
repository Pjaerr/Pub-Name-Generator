# Pub-Name-Generator
Generates random pub names by grabbing a collection of random nouns from the wordnik API and then choose two of them slotted between The WORD1 and WORD2. Created using **HTML**, **CSS/SASS** and **JavaScript**

#### I have finished with this, but there are some improvements that could be made to give better and more varied names. Some of these are marked as issues, if somebody wants to have a go at implementing any of them, feel free to make a pull request!
